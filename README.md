# AP Computer Science A Final
This is the repo for my AP Computer Science A Final. I created a web application that allows users to enter any city in the search bar and see its weather (average temperature and humidity) for the next 6 days. It utilitizes the OpenWeatherMap API (found at https://openweathermap.org/). 

# How to launch
Pre-requisites:
Make sure JDK and Maven is installed on your computer in order to run the web app

Click run on the APcsafinalApplication and input http://localhost:8080/forecast?city={city} into your browser (but replace city with the city of your choosing-- e.g Phoenix)
